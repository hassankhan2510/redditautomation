1. 🎯 "The Freelance Hunter" (High-Ticket Lead Gen)
The ROI: One client = $500+. The tool costs $10. 50x ROI.
The Hard Problem: Finding leads is easy. Qualifying them is hard.
The Feature:
Monitor: It watches Reddit (r/forhire), Upwork RSS, and Twitter for "Looking for [Your Skill]".
The AI Filter: It discards low-quality leads (e.g., "Budget $5"). It only alerts you for "Serious Buyers".
The Auto-Bid: It reads their entire job post and drafts a Hyper-Personalized Proposal referencing their specific pain points.
Why they stay: If this tool gets them 1 job a year, they will never cancel.
